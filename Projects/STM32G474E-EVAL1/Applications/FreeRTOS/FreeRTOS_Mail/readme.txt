@par Application Description

How to use mail queues with CMSIS RTOS API.

This application creates two threads that send and receive mail
the mail to send/receive is a structure that holds three variables (var1 and var2 are uint32, var3 is a uint8)

One thread acts as a producer and the other as the consumer.
The consumer is a higher priority than the producer and is set to block on mail receiving.

The Mail queue has space for one item. The producer allocates the mail and put it on the mail queue.
As soon as the producer posts a mail on the queue the consumer will unblock, preempt the producer,
get the mail and free it.

Add the following variables to LiveWatch, the three producer values must respectively remain equals to the three consumer values all the time:
 - ConsumerValue1 must remain equal to ProducerValue1
 - ConsumerValue2 must remain equal to ProducerValue2
 - ConsumerValue3 must remain equal to ProducerValue3

LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED1 should toggle when the application runs successfully.
  - LED3 is toggling when any error occurs.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
