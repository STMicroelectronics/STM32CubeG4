@par Application Description

This application describes how to use USB device application based on the Device
Communication Class (CDC) following the PSTN sub-protocol on the STM32G4xx devices.

This example is part of the USB Device Library package using STM32Cube firmware.

This is a typical application on how to use the STM32G4xx USB Device peripheral where the STM32 MCU
behaves as a USB-to-UART bridge following the Virtual COM Port (VCP) implementation.
 - On one side, the STM32 exchanges data with a PC host through USB interface in Device mode.
 - On the other side, the STM32 exchanges data with other devices (same host, other host,
   other devices…).

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick. The user is
provided with the SystemClock_Config()function to configure the clock (SYSCLK).

When the VCP application is started, the STM32 MCU is enumerated as serial communication port and is
configured in the same way (baudrate, data format, parity, stop bit) as it would configure a standard
COM port. The 7-bit data length with no parity control is NOT supported.

During enumeration phase, three communication pipes "endpoints" are declared in the CDC class
implementation (PSTN sub-class):
 - 1 x Bulk IN endpoint for receiving data from STM32 device to PC host:
   When data are received over UART they are saved in the buffer "UserTxBufferFS". Periodically, in a
   timer callback the state of the buffer "UserTxBufferFS" is checked. If there are available data, they
   are transmitted in response to IN token otherwise it is NAKed.

 - 1 x Bulk OUT endpoint for transmitting data from PC host to STM32 device:
   When data are received through this endpoint they are saved in the buffer "UserRxBufferFS" then they
   are transmitted over UART using DMA mode and in meanwhile the OUT endpoint is NAKed.
   Once the transmission is over, the OUT endpoint is prepared to receive next packet in
   HAL_UART_TxCpltCallback().

 - 1 x Interrupt IN endpoint for setting and getting serial-port parameters:
   When control setup is received, the corresponding request is executed in CDC_Control_FS().
   In this application, two requests are implemented:
    - Set line: Set the bit rate, number of Stop bits, parity, and number of data bits
    - Get line: Get the bit rate, number of Stop bits, parity, and number of data bits
   The other requests (send break, control line state) are not implemented.

@note Receiving data over UART is handled by interrupt while transmitting is handled by DMA allowing
      hence the application to receive data at the same time it is transmitting another data (full-
      duplex feature).

The support of the VCP interface is managed through the ST Virtual COM Port driver available for
download from www.st.com.

@note The user has to check the list of the COM ports in Device Manager to find out the number of the
      COM ports that have been assigned (by OS) to the VCP interface.

This application uses UART as a communication interface. The UART instance and associated resources
(GPIO, NVIC) can be tailored in "usbd_cdc_if.h" header file according to your hardware
configuration. Moreover, this application can be customized to communicate with interfaces other than UART.
For that purpose a template CDC interface is provided in:
Middlewares/ST/STM32_USB_Device_Library/Class/CDC/Src directory.

To run this application, the user can use one of the following configuration:

 - Configuration 1:
   Connect USB cable to host and UART (RS232) to a different host (PC or other device) or to same host.
   In this case, you can open two hyperterminals to send/receive data to/from host to/from device.

 - Configuration 2:
   Connect USB cable to Host and connect UART TX pin to UART RX pin on the STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B board
   (Loopback mode). In this case, you can open one terminal (relative to USB com port)
   and all data sent from this terminal will be received by the same terminal in loopback mode.
   This mode is useful for test and performance measurements.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G4xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B Set-up
  - Connect the STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B board CN22 to the PC through "TYPE-C" to "Standard A" cable.
    - For loopback mode test: connect directly USART1 TX and RX pins,
  The USART1  interface available on PA9 and PA10 of the microcontroller can be
  connected to ST-LINK MCU. The choice can be changed by setting the related jumpers.
  By default the USART1  communication between the target MCU and ST-LINK MCU is enabled.

  - Hyperterminal configuration:
    - BaudRate = 115200 baud
    - Word Length = 8 Bits
    - Stop Bit = 1
    - Parity = None
    - Flow control = None
