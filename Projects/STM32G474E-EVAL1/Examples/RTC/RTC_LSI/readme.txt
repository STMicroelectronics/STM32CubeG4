@par Example Description 

Use of the LSI clock source autocalibration to get a precise RTC clock. 
In the associated software, the system clock is set to 170 MHz.
As an application example, it demonstrates how to configure the TIM16 timer
internally connected to LSI clock output, in order to adjust the RTC prescaler. 

The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source.
After reset, the RTC prescaler is set with the default LSI frequency (). 
The RTC WakeUp is configured to generate an interrupt each 1s.

A key value is written in backup data register 1 to indicate if the wakeup timer has
already been enabled. If so the wakeup timer is disabled prior configuring the RTC 
automatic wakeup.

LED1 is toggled inside the RTC WakeUp interrupt each 1s.

The inaccuracy of the LSI clock causes the RTC WakeUp Interrupt to be inaccurate.
The RTC CK_SPRE signal can be monitored by LED1 which is toggled into the RTC 
Wakeup interrupt service routine.

The program waits until User push-button is pressed to begin the auto calibration.

Procedure:
 - Configure the TIM16 to remap internally the TIM16 TIM_CHANNEL_1
   Input Capture to the LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM16 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value.
 - The RTC prescaler is adjusted with this LSI frequency value so that the RTC
   CK_SPRE value become more accurate.
 - When calibration is done the variable uwLsiFreq is visualized into the debugger
   to indicate the end of this operation.
 - The LSI value is updated and displayed on the debugger in uwLsiFreq variable.

- LED1 is Off: This indicates that the system generates an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G474QETx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B  board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B Set-up
    - Use LED1 connected to PG.09 pin (PG.09).
    - Use the User push-button connected to pin PC.13 (External line 13)

@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
