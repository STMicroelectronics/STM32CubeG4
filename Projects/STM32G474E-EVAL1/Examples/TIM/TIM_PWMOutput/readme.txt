@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral in PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) 
mode.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32G474QETx Devices :
The CPU at 170 MHz 

SystemCoreClock is set to 170 MHz for STM32G4xx Devices.

    In this example TIM1 input clock (TIM1CLK) is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2),
    since APB2 prescaler is equal to 1.
      TIM1CLK = PCLK2
      PCLK1 = HCLK
      => TIM1CLK = HCLK = SystemCoreClock

    To get TIM1 counter clock at 85 MHz, the prescaler is computed as follows:
       Prescaler = (TIM1CLK / TIM1 counter clock) - 1
       Prescaler = ((SystemCoreClock) /85 MHz) - 1

    To get TIM1 output clock at 85 KHz, the period (ARR)) is computed as follows:
       ARR = (TIM1 counter clock / TIM1 output clock) - 1
           = 999

    TIM1 Channel1 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR1/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 50%
    TIM1 Channel2 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR2/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 37.5%
    TIM1 Channel3 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR3/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 25%
    TIM1 Channel4 duty cycle = (TIM1_CCR4/ TIM1_ARR + 1)* 100 = 12.5%

LED3 is ON when there are an error.

The PWM waveforms can be displayed using an oscilloscope.

@note The duty cycles values mentioned above are theoretical (obtained when the system clock frequency is exactly 170 MHz).
      They might be slightly different depending on system clock frequency precision.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note This example needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32G474QETx devices.
  - In this example, the clock is set to 170 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32G474E-EVAL1 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.      

  - STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B Set-up
   Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
        - TIM1_CH1 : PA.08 (pin 2 in CN5 connector)
        - TIM1_CH2 : PA.09 (pin 8 in CN5 connector)
        - TIM1_CH3 : PA.10 (pin 4 in CN5 connector)
        - TIM1_CH4 : PA.11 (pin 3 in CN5 connector)
