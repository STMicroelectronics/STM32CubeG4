@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use the TIMER peripheral to generate a single pulse when
a rising edge of an external signal is received on the TIMER Input pin.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32G474QETx Devices :
The CPU at 170 MHz 

Clock setup for TIM1
================================

  TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock = 170 MHz.
  
  Prescaler = (TIM1CLK /TIM1 counter clock) - 1
  
  The prescaler value is computed in order to have TIM1 counter clock 
  set at 1000000 Hz.
  
  The Autoreload value is 65535 (TIM1->ARR), so the maximum frequency value to 
  trigger the TIM1 input is 1000000/65535 [Hz].
 
Configuration of TIM1 in One Pulse Mode
===================================================
 
  - The external signal is connected to TIM1_CH2 pin (PA9), 
    and a rising edge on this input is used to trigger the Timer.
  - The One Pulse signal is output on TIM1_CH1 (PA8).

  The delay value is fixed to:
   - Delay =  CCR1/TIM1 counter clock 
           = 16383 / 1000000 [sec]
           
  The pulse value is fixed to : 
   - Pulse value = (TIM_Period - TIM_Pulse)/TIM1 counter clock  
                 = (65535 - 16383) / 1000000 [sec]

  The one pulse waveform can be displayed using an oscilloscope and it looks
  like this.
LED3 is ON when there are an error.

@note The delay and pulse values mentioned above are theoretical (obtained when the system clock frequency is exactly 170 MHz).
      They might be slightly different depending on system clock frequency precision.

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32G474QETx devices.
   - In this example, the clock is set to 170 MHz.
    
  - This example has been tested with STM32G474E-EVAL1 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - STM32G474E-EVAL1 Set-up
   - Connect the external signal to the TIM1_CH2 pin (PA9) (pin 8 in CN5 connector)
   - Connect the TIM1_CH1 pin(PA8) (pin 2 in CN5 connector) to an oscilloscope to monitor the waveform.  


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files: Project->Rebuild all
 - Load project image: Project->Download and Debug
 - Run program: Debug->Go(F5)
