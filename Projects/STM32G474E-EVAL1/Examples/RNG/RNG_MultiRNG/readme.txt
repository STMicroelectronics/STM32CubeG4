@par Example Description 

Configuration of the RNG using the HAL API. This example uses the RNG to generate 32-bit long random numbers.

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.
Then the SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system
clock (SYSCLK) to run at 150 MHz.

The RNG peripheral configuration is ensured by the HAL_RNG_Init() function.
The latter is calling the HAL_RNG_MspInit() function which implements
the configuration of the needed RNG resources according to the used hardware (CLOCK, 
GPIO, DMA and NVIC). You may update this function to change RNG configuration.

After startup, user is asked to press User push-button.
The 8-entry array aRandom32bit[] is filled up by 32-bit long random numbers 
at each User push-button press.

 
The random numbers can be displayed on the debugger in aRandom32bit variable.

In case of error, LED3 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.
