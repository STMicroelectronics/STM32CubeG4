@par Example Description
Use ADC Gain compensation feature to get directly voltage in mVolt from conversion
without need of data post computing.

Example configuration:
The channel is converted upon a timer trigger and result of conversions are stored
into a variable by DMA, operating in circular mode.

Example execution:
From the start, the ADC converts the selected channel continuously, DMA transfers
conversion data to a variable:
    uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt

For debug: variable to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData_Voltage_mVolt": ADC converted data in mVolt

Connection needed:
None.
Note: Voltage on analog input pin is provided by potentiometer on board,
      to perform a ADC conversion on a determined voltage level.

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  1 GPIO for analog input: PC0 (pin 46 on connector CN5)
  TIMER
  DMA

Board settings:
 - The voltage input on the ADC channel is provided by the on-board potentiometer
 (RV2). Turn RV2 to vary the ADC input voltage and observe behavior.
 - Connect jumper JP5 on 2-3 position (LDR)
 - Connect a wire between JP5 pin 1 and PC0


STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED1 is turned-on
 - Error: In case of error, LED1 is toggling twice at a frequency of 1Hz.
