@par Example Description
Use DAC dual channel mode with DMA to generate signal on both DAC channels at the same time.

Example configuration:
DAC conversions are made upon timer trigger and data feed from DMA.
DAC channel 1 is used to trig DMA feeding. Both DAC channels are triggered by the
same timer.

Example execution:
From the start, the timer is configured to trig the DAC channels at about 1kHz.
DMA is feeding both channel at the time.
Channel 1 pattern is ~0V/~1.65V/~3.3V/~1.65V
Channel 2 pattern is ~1.65V/~3.3V/~1.65V/~0V

Connection needed:
Oscilloscope probe need to be connected to PA4 (pin 41 connector CN6)
and PA5 (pin 40 connector CN6) to observe wave generation effects.

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for LED
  2 GPIOs for analog output: PA4 (pin 41 connector CN6) and PA5 (pin 40 connector CN6)
  
Board settings:



STM32G474E-EVAL1 Rev B board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED1 is turned-on
 - Error: In case of error, LED1 is toggling twice at a frequency of 1Hz.
