@par Example Brief 

This example shows how to use the built-in PGA mode (OPAMP programmable gain) with
positive or negative gain, and bias.

@par Theory

Whether the gain is negative or positive depends on the way the signals are connected
to the OPAMP inverting & non inverting inputs.

Considering Gp and Gm as the positive and negative gains, the OPAMP behavior is described by:
OPAMP OUT = Gp * Vinp - Gm * Vinm
(Vinp = signal on non inverting input of the OPAMP, Vinm = signal on inverting input of the OPAMP)

@par Example Description

This example is configuring OPAMP1 as follow:
- Inverting input: PA3 (pin 42 on connector CN6)
- Non inverting input: PA7 (pin 37 on connector CN6)
- Output: PA2 (pin 43 on connector CN6)
- Gain: Gp=2 / Gm=1 or Gp=4 / Gm=3 (User can change from one to the other using User push-button)

This example also provides signals to connect to the OPAMP inputs:
- A sine wave generated by DAC1 (PA4 - pin 41 on connector CN6)
- A bias generated by potentiometer RV2 (pin 1 - Jumper JP5)

Positive gain configuration:
- Sine wave (PA4 - pin 41 on connector CN6) is connected to
OPAMP's non inverting input (PA7 - pin 37 on connector CN6)
- Bias (pin 1 - Jumper JP5) is connected to
OPAMP's inverting input (PA3 - pin 42 on connector CN6)
- OPAMP output signal is:
  OPAMP OUT = 2 * Sine Wave - 1 * Bias   (or 4 * Sine Wave - 3 * Bias)

Negative gain configuration:
- Bias (pin 1 - Jumper JP5) is connected to
OPAMP's non inverting input (PA7 - pin 37 on connector CN6)
- Sine wave (PA4 - pin 41 on connector CN6) is connected to
OPAMP's inverting input (PA3 - pin 42 on connector CN6)
- OPAMP output signal is:
  OPAMP OUT = 2 * Bias - 1 * Sine Wave   (or 4 * Bias - 3 * Sine Wave)

- Connection needed:
      - Connect an oscilloscope to each OPAMP pin in order to observe this example behavior:
          PA3 (pin 42 on connector CN6)
          PA7 (pin 37 on connector CN6)
          PA2 (pin 43 on connector CN6)
      - Connect sine wave and bias to the OPAMP inputs and make the bias vary to observe OPAMP behavior evolution.
      - Press User push-button button to switch between gains.
      - Connect jumper JP5 on 2-3 position (LDR)

STM32G474E-EVAL Rev B board LED is be used to monitor the program execution status:
 - Normal operation: LED1 is turned-on
 - Error: In case of error, LED1 is toggling at a frequency of 1Hz.
