@par Example Description

How to use the FMAC peripheral to perform an IIR filter from IT mode to polling mode.

The FMAC peripheral is configured to perform an IIR filter with
7 feed-forward taps, 6 feedback taps and a gain equal to 1. The input and output
thresholds are set to 1. The clipping feature is disabled.

The FMAC peripheral is configured so as to use the best of its 256 x 16-bit
internal memory. This local memory is divided into three buffers:
 -   0 to  12: coefficient buffer;
 -  13 to 133: input buffer;
 - 134 to 254: output buffer;
 -        255: unused.

IT mode is used to transfer input data from memory to the FMAC peripheral.
Polling mode is used to transfer output data from FMAC peripheral to memory.

The coefficient buffer contains the concatenation of:
 - the vector of feed-forward taps, named B (here, size N = 7 elements);
 - the vector of feedback taps, named A (size comprised in [1; N-1]; here, size M = 6 elements).
This buffer is initialized during the configuration step in polling mode.

The size of the input buffer is the sum of:
 - the size of the coefficient vector B (N = 7 elements);
 - the size of the additional space D1 needed for throughput improvement
   (minimum: 0; here, D1 = 114 elements).
The input buffer is filled during the preload step in polling mode;
new values are added in IT mode once the preloaded ones have been consumed.

The size of the output buffer is the sum of:
 - the size of the coefficient A buffer (M = 6 elements);
 - the size of the additional space D2 needed for a better throughput
   (minimum: 1; here, D2 = 115 elements).
The output buffer is initialized during the preload step in polling mode
and read in polling mode when the result is available.

The input data will be loaded in three times to demonstrate the preload and the writing through interrupt:
 - 121 elements written during the preload (the input buffer is entirely filled);
 - 194 elements provided when requested through callback (when the preloaded data has been used);
 - 197 elements provided when requested through callback (when the previous data has been used).

The output data will be read in four times in polling mode:
 - buffer of 169 elements provided when starting the filter;
 - buffer of 168 elements provided through polling when the previous buffer has been filled;
 - buffer of 84 elements provided through polling when the previous buffer has been filled;
 - buffer of 84 elements provided through polling when the previous buffer has been filled.

With 512 input elements, the FMAC peripheral will be able to compute 508 output elements.
These output elements are stored in the arrays aCalculatedFilteredData1[], aCalculatedFilteredData2[],
aCalculatedFilteredData3[] and aCalculatedFilteredData4[]. This result is compared to
the expected one contained in aRefFilteredData[] in order to detect a possible error.

STM32 board LED is used to monitor the example status:
  - LED2 is ON when correct FMAC IIR results have been calculated.
  - LED2 is blinking (1 second period) if an error is detected
    in the IIR filter results or if there is an initialization or configuration error.

@note This example must be tested in release mode (not in debug). When using in debug mode,
be aware that the IDE may perform read operations to update the Registers Debugging Window.
Then any read on FMAC RDATA register can interfere on the expected behavior of the example.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to
      1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.
